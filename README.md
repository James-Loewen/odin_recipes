First web project on The Odin Project

I have previously (and recently) completed the
freeCodeCamp Responsive Webdesign certification course.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, I mean, here I am taking
yet another full walkthrough course on html, css
and javascript.

That said, I'm drawn to the teaching and information-
presentation style of TOP. Even though I haven't learned
any new technical information, I feel like I've gotten
some background and contextual information that helps
deepen my understanding of concepts I've been using.

Anyway, this project is a simple, html-only recipe
website project. I may include some css if I can't
stand looking at a naked page. What I plan to focus on
are concepts like content structure and flow. Making
smart use of containers (<div>, <article>, <section>,
etc.) while maintaining simplicity.
