  <h2>I'm not sure it's 100% cool for us to be calling it this? But this is what my mom called it growing up and I don't
    think she had bad intentions... I think it just made her think of open fires maybe?</h2>
  <p>This was a staple growing up. It's a staple now. My girlfriend and I eat this for dinner most nights before sending
    some big Catskills hike.</p>
  <p>Something you <em>must</em> understand is the following: this dish is made with turkey-dogs. If you cannot handle
    or accept
    that, I've included at <a href="#weeny">anchor tag</a> at the very bottom of this page specifically for you.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You must have noodles</li>
    <li>Sauce, I suppose is needed</li>
    <li>I'm a meatm'n myself, but I can respect a veggie lasagna</li>
    <li>Excuse me, did I almost forget cheese? Oh my...</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps For to Cook/Assemble the Thing:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Boil your noodles and lay them out delicately</li>
    <li>Sauce those bad men up and spread some meat and cheese on 'em</li>
    <li>Time for another steamy noodle blanket</li>
    <li>Once he's big and tall, toss your guy in the oven and <strong>bake</strong> him</li>
  </ol>
